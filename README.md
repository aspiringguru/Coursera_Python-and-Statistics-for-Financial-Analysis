# Coursera_Python-and-Statistics-for-Financial-Analysis


#getting started

I find it useful to have the course contents for offline study. This may be controversial for some, the app enables downloading content for offline study. The annoying part is you still need to click through on the website to record progress.

pip install coursera-dl
coursera-dl -u <user> -p <pass> python-statistics-financial-analysis

## install Anaconda & setup


##use git and github

some quick and useful notes

git status
git reset --hard
